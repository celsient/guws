- [set 1](https://discord.com/channels/965318441089237033/1021126211059077261):
  - how do large groups of people live together? what are cities like? how are they supplied? what customs arise from the clashing of culture?
  - what monuments do people construct in your setting? do they serve a practical purpose or are they merely for vanity?
- [set 2](https://discord.com/channels/965318441089237033/1023207959607652532):
  - how do people get around? is there public transport? private? what kinds of infrastructure have been made for travel? do your world's inhabitants have fundamentally different ways of moving around? flight? swimming?
  - the most crucial question in making a fleshed out setting: how do they eat? are heavy trade networks required? are people mostly self-sufficient?
