# Weekly prompts for the 2022-2023 academic year
## INFRASTRUCTURE month (September 2022)
- set 1:
  - how do large groups of people live together? what are cities like? how are they supplied? what customs arise from the clashing of culture?
  - what monuments do people construct in your setting? do they serve a practical purpose or are they merely for vanity?
