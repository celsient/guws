![Glasgow University Worldbuilding & Storytelling society logo. Comprised of the letters G U W S in white on a blue background, a traffic cone, and a goose whose neck is the S](https://github.com/guws0/guws/blob/5954321298c437a7b13651d755d2677fdb880262/GUWS%20logo.png)
Welcome to our GitHub page! Here you can find our constitution and the changes it's been through over time, as well as other documents we think are useful to the membership (our logo + its .ase file, meeting minutes, a list of our property, etc.).

Our logo is designed by [Pavizi](https://pavizi.tumblr.com/)

We are currently unlicensed, however other societies are welcome and encouraged to steal articles from our constitution. I (GUWS pres #1) would love to talk about suggestions and thoughts you have regarding it :]
